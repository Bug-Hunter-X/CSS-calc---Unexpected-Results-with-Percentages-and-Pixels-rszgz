The CSS property `calc()` might produce unexpected results if used with percentages and other units without careful consideration of the order of operations. For instance, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` might not behave as expected if the containing element's width is not explicitly set.  The calculation is performed relative to the element's *initial* containing block, not its final computed width.
